# SqlServerUserSample

This sample shows how to use a *SQL Server User* to establish a connection.

Using this method is the most basic way to connect to *Microsoft SQL Server* and it's also the way, that really every *SQL Server client library* supports.

## Dependencies

In this sample I used the open source library `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` which is available as *NuGet* package.  
The complete source code can be found at [GitHub dotnet/SqlClient](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient).
